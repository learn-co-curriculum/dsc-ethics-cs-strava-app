# Case Study - Strava Fitness App

## Introduction
In the publication __Data Pollution__ (Ben-Shahar, 2018), the author Omir Ben-Shahar asserts the following:

> (An) example illustrating how a database can reveal information affecting public interests other than the users’ privacy is the Strava fitness app—the
self-proclaimed “social network for athletes.” Strava enables millions of users to
post map depictions of their physical workouts online, to be then viewed en
masse in a “heat map” that may be accessed by anyone. Because the map exposes large concentrated clusters of users in areas of dense activity, it allows
detection of secret geographic locations of U.S. military operations around the
world.13 What else could a cluster of physical workouts in the Sahara Desert, or
in an outskirt of an Afghan city, stand for? It is through the aggregation of the
personal data that a meta-picture emerges, and it threatens a public good—
national security—not the individual privacy of any specific data sharer.
